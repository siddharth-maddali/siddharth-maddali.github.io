  abstract      = {Coherent X-ray photons with energies higher than 50 keV offer new possibilities for imaging nanoscale lattice distortions in bulk crystalline materials using Bragg peak phase retrieval methods. However, the compression of reciprocal space at high energies typically results in poorly resolved fringes on an area detector, rendering the diffraction data unsuitable for the three-dimensional reconstruction of compact crystals. To address this problem, we propose a method by which to recover fine fringe detail in the scattered intensity. This recovery is achieved in two steps: multiple undersampled measurements are made by in-plane sub-pixel motion of the area detector, then this data set is passed to a sparsity-based numerical solver that recovers fringe detail suitable for standard Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) reconstruction methods of compact single crystals. The key insight of this paper is that sparsity in a BCDI data set can be enforced by recognising that the signal in the detector, though poorly resolved, is band-limited. This requires fewer in-plane detector translations for complete signal recovery, while adhering to information theory limits. We use simulated BCDI data sets to demonstrate the approach, outline our sparse recovery strategy, and comment on future opportunities.},

  abstract = {Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) is a powerful technique to explore the local strain state and morphology of microscale crystals. The method can potentially reach nanometer-scale spatial resolution thanks to the advances in synchrotron design that dramatically increase coherent flux. However, there are experimental bottlenecks that may limit the image reconstruction quality from future high signal-to-noise ratio measurements. In this work we show that angular uncertainty of the sample orientation with respect to a fixed incoming beam is one example of such a factor, and we present a method to mitigate the resulting artifacts. On the basis of an alternative formulation of the forward problem, we design a phase retrieval algorithm which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of the object and determination of the exact angular position corresponding to each diffraction pattern in the data set. We have tested the algorithm performance on simulated data for different degrees of angular uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio.},

In these methods, the object can be recovered by minimizing an error metric that quantifies the difference between diffraction patterns as observed, and those calculated from a present guess of the object. Efficient minimization methods require analytical calculation of the derivatives of the error metric, which is not always straightforward. This limits our ability to explore variations of basic imaging approaches. In this paper, we propose to substitute analytical derivative expressions with the automatic differentiation method, whereby we can achieve object reconstruction by specifying only the physics-based experimental forward model. We demonstrate the generality of the proposed method through straightforward object reconstruction for a variety of complex ptychographic experimental models.},

  abstract  = {The goals of this work were to develop tools to visualize and characterize materials information, to explore new alloy compositions and/or processing, to better predict tensile strength and other mechanical properties. The 9â12â¯wt% Cr (9Cr) steel test data were compiled from several sources. About 3000 records with 30 predictor variables represent 82 unique steel alloy compositions, variations of thermo-mechanical processing steps and temperatures (homogenization, normalization and tempering cycles), test conditions and outcomes. Detailed data processing steps such as visualization and exploratory analysis, including univariate and bivariate analysis, different clustering techniques used to segment the data, statistical post-hoc analysis to verify significance of the findings, feature engineering to identify predictors of importance, and predictive modeling with cross-validation were performed. The outcome of analysis at each step was reviewed in the context of the domain knowledge of this class of steel, to see if there were underlying physical mechanisms that explain statistical relationships. Data analytics techniques and their parameters were fine-tuned to facilitate interpretation of the results as aligned with the insights from domain experts. The ensemble predictive modeling using Random Forest regressor and post-hoc means comparison corroborated domain knowledge on the role of Co which is known to increase strength of steel alloys through solid-solution strengthening and to affect diffusion of alloying elements and precipitates. Alloys with Co content of 0.7â8â¯wt% had significantly higher mean strength than the ones without (while having Cr locked within 10â11â¯wt% range in either group and keeping other compositional element ratios fixed). End products of the computational techniques exploration are presented as the tools that can be used in iterative workflow of materials development and testing.},

This approach was applied to micrometre-sized individual grains in a Cu(In,Ga)Se${\sb 2}$ polycrystalline film packaged in a working device. It was found that, near grain boundaries, collection efficiency is increased, and that in these regions the lattice parameter of the material is expanded.

However, the nanoscale strain distribution in operational devices is not easily accessible using standard methods. X-ray nanodiffraction offers the unique possibility to evaluate the strain or lattice spacing at nanoscale resolution. Furthermore, the combination of nanodiffraction with additional techniques in the framework of multimodal scanning X-ray microscopy enables the direct correlation of the strain with material and device parameters such as the elemental distribution or local performance. This approach is applied for the investigation of the strain distribution in CdTe grains in fully operational photovoltaic solar cells. It is found that the lattice spacing in the (111) direction remains fairly constant in the grain cores but systematically decreases at the GBs. The lower strain at GBs is accompanied by an increase of the total tilt. These observations are both compatible with the inhomogeneous incorporation of smaller atoms into the lattice, and local stress induced by neighboring grains.},

  abstract = {This two-part article series provides a generalized description of the scattering geometry of Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) experiments, the shear distortion effects inherent in the 3D image obtained from presently used methods and strategies to mitigate this distortion. Part I starts from fundamental considerations to present the general real-space coordinate transformation required to correct this shear, in a compact operator formulation that easily lends itself to implementation with available software packages. Such a transformation, applied as a final post-processing step following phase retrieval, is crucial for arriving at an undistorted, correctly oriented and physically meaningful image of the 3D crystalline scatterer. As the relevance of BCDI grows in the field of materials characterization, the available sparse literature that addresses the geometric theory of BCDI and the subsequent analysis methods are generalized here. This geometrical aspect, specific to coherent Bragg diffraction and absent in 2D transmission CDI experiments, gains particular importance when it comes to spatially resolved characterization of 3D crystalline materials in a reliable nondestructive manner. This series of articles describes this theory, from the diffraction in Bragg geometry to the corrections needed to obtain a properly rendered digital image of the 3D scatterer. Part I of this series provides the experimental BCDI community with the general form of the 3D real-space distortions in the phase-retrieved object, along with the necessary post-retrieval correction method. Part II builds upon the geometric theory developed in Part I with the formalism to correct the shear distortions directly on an orthogonal grid within the phase-retrieval algorithm itself, allowing more physically realistic constraints to be applied. Taken together, Parts I and II provide the X-ray science community with a set of generalized BCDI shear-correction techniques crucial to the final rendering of a 3D crystalline scatterer and for the development of new BCDI methods and experiments.},

  abstract = {X-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) has been demonstrated as a powerful 3D microscopy approach for the investigation of sub-micrometre-scale crystalline particles. The approach is based on the measurement of a series of coherent Bragg diffraction intensity patterns that are numerically inverted to retrieve an image of the spatial distribution of the relative phase and amplitude of the Bragg structure factor of the diffracting sample. This 3D information, which is collected through an angular rotation of the sample, is necessarily obtained in a non-orthogonal frame in Fourier space that must be eventually reconciled. To deal with this, the approach currently favored by practitioners (detailed in Part I) is to perform the entire inversion in conjugate non-orthogonal real- and Fourier-space frames, and to transform the 3D sample image into an orthogonal frame as a post-processing step for result analysis. In this article, which is a direct follow-up of Part I, two different transformation strategies are demonstrated, which enable the entire inversion procedure of the measured data set to be performed in an orthogonal frame. The new approaches described here build mathematical and numerical frameworks that apply to the cases of evenly and non-evenly sampled data along the direction of sample rotation ({\it i.e.} the rocking curve). The value of these methods is that they rely on the experimental geometry, and they incorporate significantly more information about that geometry into the design of the phase-retrieval Fourier transformation than the strategy presented in Part I. Two important outcomes are (1) that the resulting sample image is correctly interpreted in a shear-free frame and (2) physically realistic constraints of BCDI phase retrieval that are difficult to implement with current methods are easily incorporated. Computing scripts are also given to aid readers in the implementation of the proposed formalisms.},

  abstract    = {This paper addresses three-dimensional signal distortion and image reconstruction issues in x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) in the event of a non-trivial, non-orthogonal orientation of the area detector with respect to the diffracted beam. Growing interest in novel BCDI adaptations at fourth-generation synchrotron light sources has necessitated improvisations in the experimental configuration and the subsequent data analysis. One such possibly unavoidable improvisation that is envisioned in this paper is a photon-counting area detector whose face is tilted away from the perpendicular to the Bragg-diffracted beam during acquisition of the coherent diffraction signal. We describe a likely circumstance in which one would require such a detector configuration. Using physically accurate diffraction simulations from synthetic scatterers in the presence of such tilted detectors, we analyze the general nature of the observed signal distortion qualitatively and quantitatively, and provide a prescription to correct for it during image reconstruction. Our simulations and reconstructions are based on an adaptation of the known theory of BCDI sampling geometry as well as recently developed geometry-aware projection-based methods of wavefield propagation. Such configurational modifications and their numerical remedies are potentially valuable in realizing unconventional coherent diffraction measurement configurations and eventually paving the way for novel materials characterization experiments in the future.},
