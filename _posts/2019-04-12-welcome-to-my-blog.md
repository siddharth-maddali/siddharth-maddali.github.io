Watch this space for a heterogeneous but (I hope) interesting collection of posts on topics in physics, mathematics and what I like to call "little programming victories". 

Among other things, I will write about things that draw inspiration from my work. 
For the most part smaller problems I've had to deal with as part of a bigger effort, but which I feel are interesting in their own right.
I hope you enjoy the content here.
Please do drop me an email with any comments!
