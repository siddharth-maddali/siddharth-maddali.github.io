Watch this space for a heterogeneous but (I hope) interesting posts on topics in physics, math and what I like to call "little programming victories". 

I plan to write on things that draw inspiration from my work, in  the form of little problems I've had to deal with as part of a bigger effort.
I hope you enjoy the content you find!
