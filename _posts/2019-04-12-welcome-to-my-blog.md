Watch this space for deliberately random but (I hope) interesting posts on things ranging from physics to math to graphics and visualization to algorithms and software.

I plan to write on things that draw inspiration from my work, in  the form of little problems I've had to deal with as part of a bigger effort.
I hope you enjoy the content you find!
