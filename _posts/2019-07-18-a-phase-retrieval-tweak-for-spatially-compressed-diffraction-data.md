<a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/a-sharper-focus-new-computational-technique-resolves-compressed-xray-data">Here</a>'s an Argonne press release of some of my x-ray imaging work recently published in _Phys. Rev. A_.

This has been part of my very productive postdoc work over the last two years. 
We've basically demonstrated a method to increase the resolution of inevitably "corrupted" detector images acquired when highly penetrating x-rays scatter off of crystals, while at the same time obtaining a 3D picture of the scattering crystal from these low-resolution images (a process known as "phase retrieval"). 
Methods like this will become particularly important when new, powerful synchrotron x-ray facilities come online in the very near future.
