  abstract      = {Coherent X-ray beams with energies $\geq 50$ keV can potentially enable
three-dimensional imaging of atomic lattice distortion fields within
individual crystallites in bulk polycrystalline materials through Bragg
coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI). However, the undersampling of the
diffraction signal due to Fourier space compression at high X-ray
energies renders conventional phase retrieval algorithms unsuitable for
three-dimensional reconstruction. To address this problem we utilize a
phase retrieval method with a Fourier constraint specifically tailored
for undersampled diffraction data measured with coarse-pitched detector
pixels that bin the underlying signal. With our approach, we show that
it is possible to reconstruct three-dimensional strained crystallites
from an undersampled Bragg diffraction data set subject to pixel-area
integration without having to physically upsample the diffraction
signal. Using simulations and experimental results, we demonstrate that
explicit modeling of Fourier space compression during phase retrieval
provides a viable means by which to invert high-energy BCDI data, which
is otherwise intractable.},

  abstract      = {Coherent X-ray photons with energies higher than 50 keV offer new possibilities for imaging nanoscale lattice distortions in bulk crystalline materials using Bragg peak phase retrieval methods. However, the compression of reciprocal space at high energies typically results in poorly resolved fringes on an area detector, rendering the diffraction data unsuitable for the three-dimensional reconstruction of compact crystals. To address this problem, we propose a method by which to recover fine fringe detail in the scattered intensity. This recovery is achieved in two steps: multiple undersampled measurements are made by in-plane sub-pixel motion of the area detector, then this data set is passed to a sparsity-based numerical solver that recovers fringe detail suitable for standard Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) reconstruction methods of compact single crystals. The key insight of this paper is that sparsity in a BCDI data set can be enforced by recognising that the signal in the detector, though poorly resolved, is band-limited. This requires fewer in-plane detector translations for complete signal recovery, while adhering to information theory limits. We use simulated BCDI data sets to demonstrate the approach, outline our sparse recovery strategy, and comment on future opportunities.},

  abstract      = {Coherent diffraction imaging methods enable imaging beyond lens-imposed
resolution limits. In these methods, the object can be recovered by
minimizing an error metric that quantifies the difference between
diffraction patterns as observed, and those calculated from a present
guess of the object. Efficient minimization methods require analytical
calculation of the derivatives of the error metric, which is not always
straightforward. This limits our ability to explore variations of basic
imaging approaches. In this paper, we propose to substitute analytical
derivative expressions with the automatic differentiation method,
whereby we can achieve object reconstruction by specifying only the
physics-based experimental forward model. We demonstrate the generality
of the proposed method through straightforward object reconstruction for
a variety of complex ptychographic experimental models.

  Abstract                 = {The goals of this work were to develop tools to visualize and characterize materials information, to explore new alloy compositions and/or processing, to better predict tensile strength and other mechanical properties. The 9â12â¯wt% Cr (9Cr) steel test data were compiled from several sources. About 3000 records with 30 predictor variables represent 82 unique steel alloy compositions, variations of thermo-mechanical processing steps and temperatures (homogenization, normalization and tempering cycles), test conditions and outcomes. Detailed data processing steps such as visualization and exploratory analysis, including univariate and bivariate analysis, different clustering techniques used to segment the data, statistical post-hoc analysis to verify significance of the findings, feature engineering to identify predictors of importance, and predictive modeling with cross-validation were performed. The outcome of analysis at each step was reviewed in the context of the domain knowledge of this class of steel, to see if there were underlying physical mechanisms that explain statistical relationships. Data analytics techniques and their parameters were fine-tuned to facilitate interpretation of the results as aligned with the insights from domain experts. The ensemble predictive modeling using Random Forest regressor and post-hoc means comparison corroborated domain knowledge on the role of Co which is known to increase strength of steel alloys through solid-solution strengthening and to affect diffusion of alloying elements and precipitates. Alloys with Co content of 0.7â8â¯wt% had significantly higher mean strength than the ones without (while having Cr locked within 10â11â¯wt% range in either group and keeping other compositional element ratios fixed). End products of the computational techniques exploration are presented as the tools that can be used in iterative workflow of materials development and testing.},

  abstract      = {We present proof-of-concept imaging measurements of a polycrystalline material that integrate the elements of conventional high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy with coherent diffraction imaging techniques, and that can enable in-situ strain-sensitive imaging of lattice structure in ensembles of deeply embedded crystals over five decades of length scale upon full realization. Such multi-scale imaging capabilities are critical to addressing important questions in a variety of research areas such as materials science and engineering, chemistry, and solid state physics. Towards this eventual goal, the following key aspects are demonstrated: 1) high-energy Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (HE-BCDI) of sub-micron-scale crystallites at 52 keV at current third-generation synchrotron light sources, 2) HE-BCDI performed in conjunction with far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy (ff-HEDM) on the grains of a polycrystalline sample in an smoothly integrated manner, and 3) the orientation information of an ensemble of grains obtained via ff-HEDM used to perform complementary HE-BCDI on multiple Bragg reflections of a single targeted grain. These steps lay the foundation for integration of HE-BCDI, which typically provides a spatial resolution tens of nanometers, into a broad suite of well-established HEDM methods, extending HEDM beyond the few-micrometer resolution bound and into the nanoscale, and positioning the approach to take full advantage of the orders-of-magnitude improvement of X-ray coherence expected at fourth generation light sources presently being built and commissioned worldwide.},
