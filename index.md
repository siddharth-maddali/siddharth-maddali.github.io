# Hello! 

You've reached the personal website of Siddharth Maddali.
I do research at the intersection of condensed matter physics and X-ray imaging. I currently live in Chicago, IL.

You can read more about me <a href="{{ site.url }}/about">here</a>, take a look at my physics/math/programming <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog">blog</a>, and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/SidDarthious?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @SidDarthious on Twitter</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>.

Meanwhile, for no reason at all, here's a picture I took that I really like...
