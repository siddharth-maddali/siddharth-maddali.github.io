# Hello! 

You've reached the personal website of Siddharth Maddali.
I'm a physicist who researching ways to characterize condensed matter systems with electromagnetic waves. 
I currently live in Milpitas, CA.

You can read more about me <a href="{{ site.url }}/about">here</a>, take a look at my physics/math/programming <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog">blog</a>, and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/SidDarthious?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @SidDarthious on Twitter</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>. 
Or better yet, <a href="https://qoto.org/@siddarthious" class="mstdn">Follow siddarthious<span>qoto.org</span></a>.

Meanwhile, for no reason at all, here's a picture I took that I really like...
