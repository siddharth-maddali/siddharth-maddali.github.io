# Hello! 

You've reached the personal website of Siddharth Maddali.
I'm a physicist at Argonne National Laboratory and I work on the intersection of materials science and diffraction-based characterization.

You can read more about me <a href="{{ site.url }}/about">here</a>, take at my physics/math/programming <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog">blog</a>, and/or follow my updates on Twitter.

Meanwhile, here's a picture I took that I really like...
