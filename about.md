I am a physicist and I work at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, IL. 
If you go back far enough, I'm from Bengaluru, India but I've done a bit of bouncing between the south and the west of India when I was growing up. I was born in B'lore, but grew up in Pune and now based out of B'lore again.
