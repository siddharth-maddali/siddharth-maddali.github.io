# I may not be $\left\langle e^{tx}\right\rangle$, but I have my moments...

I currently live in Chicago, IL and I'm a physicist at Argonne National Laboratory.
If you go back far enough, I'm originally from Bengaluru, India but I've done a bit of bouncing between the south and the west of India while growing up. 
I was born in Bangalore, but grew up in Pune and I've now established roots back in Bangalore again.

I'm a sucker for all things applied math, as you can probably tell from that groan-inducing [$\left\langle e^{tx} \right\rangle$ title joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function).
My [career trajectory]({{site.url}}/resume-cv/resume#workex) in physics has been fairly uni-directional ever since high school, with little happening to make me change my mind and pivot elsewhere...so far!

My broad area of expertise is X-ray imaging and computational materials science which happen to be highly inter-disciplinary fields. 
I spend most of my time figuring out new ways to image things down to a few nanometers by shining X-rays on them.
Being able to see what bunches of atoms are doing (a few thousand in a bunch) without destroying what you're looking at is important if you're a scientist or an engineer designing a new material, or just trying to understand materials better.
This includes people who design new alloys and want to know how it will behave when you strain or heat it, or scientists studying battery cathodes or catalytic particles in action.

Anyway, this makes Argonne one of the best places for materials research, because of their [giant X-ray machine](https://www.aps.anl.gov/About/Overview), for which I'm currently designing new experiments.
A lot of this work is just me sitting at a desk simulating such diffraction experiments for different materials, with the occasional week-long experiment at the Advanced Photon Source.
I absolutely love the fact that I work a field that involves using a wide range of skills.
This is in fact a very exciting, dynamic area of research, and [it's only going to get better](https://www.aps.anl.gov/APS-Upgrade/News/DOE-approves-technical-plan-and-cost-estimate-to-upgrade-Argonne-facility)!

Interesting bit of trivia: the world's first ever nuclear reactor (Chicago Pile-1) is buried somewhere on the old site of the laboratory.

Interesting bit of trivia #2: the X-ray beam at Argonne is so carefully aligned that it is sensitive to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/argonne/32879127374">earthquakes at the other end of the world</a>.

I was also a post-doc at the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Pittsburgh, PA, where I worked on materials discovery using machine learning.


At other times, I'm usually playing squash, swimming, looking to learn new math stuff completely orthogonal to my work, trying to achieve Linux supremacy, contributing to open-source software or drinking new beers I come across (after all, I am a Bangalorean!).
I am a big fan of the great outdoors and have absolutely loved every single one of my hikes, treks and visits to national and state parks around the US.
I am appropriately wary of social media but nevertheless use Twitter (and other aggregators) to get my daily internet fix.
I occasionally tweet stuff that I find interesting, but don't even bother looking for me on Facebook or Instagram.

My wife Ranjini is from Kochi, India, a mathematician by training, data scientist by trade and Carnatic music enthusiast.
We met in Chennai as students way back in 2007.
